### Anti Selfie
#### 10.01.2019

Today we find ourselves facing new challenges, not because this definition of design has changed much, but because the products weâ€™re required to build have changed. We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices. But a digital product is not the same as a printed product. Digital products are displayed on screens of different sizes and with dynamic content. Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation. Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. All in all, digital products all share a common trait: They are created with programming languages.
